# MY FIRST WEBSITE  

Frustration is real...  
Experienced a lot through trial and error, which solidified my basic knowledge.  

## Frontend  
- Static HTML, CSS  
- EJS for dynamic content  
- JavaScript  

## Backend  
- Node.js  
- Express.js  
- No database yet (used an array to store blog data temporarily)  

## Build Command  
```sh
npm install
```

## Start the Server  
```sh
node SERVER.js
```

The server will run locally on:  
**http://localhost:3000**
